# self-attest-india
When you need to sign hundreds of pages, and the bureaucrats are going to give you hand cramps.

Indian law sometimes requires self-attestation. You take a digital copy of your documents (whether an ID, passport, etc) and you sign in blue ink, partially across the picture and off into the whitespace.

Here's a faster way to get your self-attestation done. We'll call it machine-assisted self-attestation.

## Usage
- Clone this, and drop some images into the folder alongside Document.html
- Adjust the list of images inside Document.html
- Open the file in Chrome, File->Print, and ðŸŽ‰ you have self-attested documents!

Nice to combine with digital scan services like http://lookslikescanned.com/
*IMPORTANT* just make sure not to upload sensitive info to a public site, such as your SSN.
